# Kvorum modelling system

Author: Karpov V.E.

"The agent-based modeling environment to explore certain design decisions and facilitate simulation usage in the field of group robotics. Kvorum a simulation system that should adequately abstract away complexities of a physical system while providing convenient interfaces and library modules for modeling groups of mobile land robots and individual agent’s intrinsic structures. It was built from the ground up as a modular, highly extensible system focused on speed of calculations that is to be achieved by using proper simplification of physical and other effects, and by the ability to perform simulations using parallel computing."
